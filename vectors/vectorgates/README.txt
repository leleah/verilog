Build a circuit that has two 3-bit inputs that computes the bitwise-OR of the two vectors, the logical-OR of the two vectors, and the inverse (NOT) of both vectors. Place the inverse of b in the upper half of out_not (i.e., bits [5:3]), and the inverse of a in the lower half.
Bitwise vs. Logical Operators

Earlier, we mentioned that there are bitwise and logical versions of the various boolean operators (e.g., norgate). When using vectors, the distinction between the two operator types becomes important. A bitwise operation between two N-bit vectors replicates the operation for each bit of the vector and produces a N-bit output, while a logical operation treats the entire vector as a boolean value (true = non-zero, false = zero) and produces a 1-bit output.

Look at the simulation waveforms at how the bitwise-OR and logical-OR differ.
